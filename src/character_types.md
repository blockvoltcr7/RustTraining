In Rust, there is only one character type: char.

A char in Rust represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. char literals are specified with single quotes, like 'a'.

Each char is four bytes in size, which is larger than in many other languages, but this allows it to represent a wide range of characters. For example, you can have a char that represents an emoji like 'ðŸš€'.
