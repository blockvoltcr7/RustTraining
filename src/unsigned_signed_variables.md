In Rust, as in many other programming languages, integers can be either signed or unsigned.

Signed integers can represent both positive and negative numbers. They are represented in two's complement form. In Rust, signed integers are denoted by i followed by the number of bits they occupy in memory. For example, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, and isize.

Unsigned integers can only represent non-negative numbers (i.e., zero and positive numbers). They are denoted by u followed by the number of bits they occupy in memory. For example, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, and usize.

The difference between them is that signed integers use one bit to indicate the sign of the value, which halves the highest number they can represent compared to unsigned integers of the same size. For example, an i8 can represent numbers from -128 to 127, while a u8 can represent numbers from 0 to 255.
