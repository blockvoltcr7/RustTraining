In Rust, as in many other programming languages, integers can be either signed or unsigned.

Signed integers can represent both positive and negative numbers. They are represented in two's complement form. In Rust, signed integers are denoted by i followed by the number of bits they occupy in memory. For example, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, and isize.

Unsigned integers can only represent non-negative numbers (i.e., zero and positive numbers). They are denoted by u followed by the number of bits they occupy in memory. For example, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, and usize.

The difference between them is that signed integers use one bit to indicate the sign of the value, which halves the highest number they can represent compared to unsigned integers of the same size. For example, an i8 can represent numbers from -128 to 127, while a u8 can represent numbers from 0 to 255.


In Rust, usize is an unsigned integer type that is used primarily for indexing collections and other size-related uses. The size of usize is determined by the architecture of the machine your program is running on: on a 32-bit architecture, usize will be 32 bits, and on a 64-bit architecture, usize will be 64 bits.

Here's an example of how you might use usize:

fn main() {
    let index: usize = 5;
    let array: [i32; 10] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    // Use index to access an element of the array
    println!("{}", array[index]);
}

In this example, index is a usize used to index into array. This code will print 6, the element at index 5 in array.

so if i use usize it means it will assign the bit size based on my machine architecture?

Yes, that's correct. In Rust, usize is an unsigned integer type whose size is determined by the architecture of the machine your program is running on.

If your program is running on a 32-bit architecture, usize will be 32 bits (4 bytes), and if it's running on a 64-bit architecture, usize will be 64 bits (8 bytes).

This makes usize particularly useful for indexing collections and representing sizes that must be the same as the address space of the machine, such as the length of a Vec or the size of a file.
